# The How to Guide

## Hosting your first Rails Girls event
 
Our aim is to give tools for women to understand technology. The Rails Girls events do this by providing a great first experience on building the Internet. 

Rails Girls was founded in end of 2010 in Helsinki. Originally intended as a onetime event, we never thought to see so many local chapters all around the world! This guide has been put together to help you get started.

Please contact us at contact@railsgirls.com if you want to organise a local chapter. The roadmap for future events can be seen at [www.railsgirls.com](http://railsgirls.com).


### The Basics
Rails Girls events are non-profit. We don’t charge the participants and do not pay for coaches or speakers. Participants don’t need any previous knowledge about programming and there are no age-limitations. All the participants need is a laptop and some curiosity.
      
The two-day event includes a lot of small group working and short focused talks on programming, design and web. No panel discussions or podium-talks - the spirit should be informal and hands-on. The more you can remove abstractions and add inclusivity the better.

#### Rails Girls philosophy

* Show sparks, personality and keep in mind the big picture. Explain, repeat and always tie what your telling into a larger context.
* Internet was made by people and it doesn’t break by a little tinkering. Continuously show the human side: encourage coaches to talk about open source communities, their programming idols and their aspirations.
* Copy-pasting rules. Programming per ce isn’t central - you can't really learn to speak chinese in one day, in a similar manner you can only learn the basic vocabulary and expressions in coding. The goal of every event is to make something visible!
* Girls run this world! But also women, ladies, even boys are allowed in. More than semantics we're interested in a mindset. Both founders we're born in the Spice Girls era, they don't see the word girl as condescending or cutesy-cute.
